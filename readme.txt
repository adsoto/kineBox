kineBox - A Matlab toolbox for analyzing motion from videos.  Should be compatible with versions 2015a and later.  Some functions may require the image processing toolbox.

Developed by the McHenry Lab at UC Irvine. 


Basic operations  ---------------------------

defineVidObject - Identifies the key properties of a video and returns them in a structure (v).

getFrame - Reads image file from a video, using v structure generated by defineVidObject.

imInteract - Interactively prompts the user to select feature from a single image


Image processing ---------------------------

tracker - Tracks the motion of an object in a video sequence

findBlobs - Returns info on blobs defined by threshold and area bounds.





Examples
